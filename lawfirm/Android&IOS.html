 <!-- Web App Development -->

 <!-- A web developer’s primary role is to build websites. While their main responsibility is ensuring the website is both visually appealing and easy to use, they are also often tasked with optimizing the website’s performance and handling its capacity requirements.

Types of Web Developers
Web developers generally fall into one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also serve as webmasters. Here’s a closer look at each of these roles:

Back-end web developers focus on the underlying structure of the website. They write and test the code that powers the site, ensuring everything functions correctly. Their tasks may also include managing access controls for others who need to update or manage the site’s content.

Front-end web developers work on the user-facing side of the website—the pages that visitors interact with (also known as the user interface). They are responsible for designing the layout of each page, integrating visual elements, and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the overall user experience.

Full-stack developers are skilled in both back-end and front-end development. These developers can build an entire website from start to finish and are often employed by companies that need a versatile developer due to budget constraints.

Webmasters manage and maintain websites. Their main role is to ensure the site remains up-to-date, checking that links and functionalities across all pages are working correctly.

Web Developer Duties and Responsibilities
Whether working for a company, an agency, or as a freelancer, a web developer’s tasks may vary, but typical daily responsibilities often include:

Designing user interfaces and navigation structures
Writing and reviewing code for websites, usually in HTML, XML, or JavaScript
Integrating multimedia content such as images, videos, and interactive elements
Testing web applications to ensure functionality
Troubleshooting and resolving issues related to site performance or user experience
Collaborating with designers, developers, and project stakeholders -->





<!-- SEO:-
An SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Specialist’s role is to enhance the volume of organic traffic a website receives from search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. This is accomplished through a combination of on-page and off-page techniques, such as link building, social media strategies, viral marketing, metadata optimization, website speed improvements, content planning, and data architecture. Due to the constant updates to search engine algorithms, an SEO specialist works in a fast-paced environment that demands continuous learning, refining of skills, and testing to stay ahead of industry trends.

SEO Specialist Duties & Responsibilities
Develop strategies to improve the website’s search engine ranking and overall visibility.
Conduct tests, gather and analyze data, identify trends, and extract insights to optimize ROI.
Manage the budget for SEO campaigns, ensuring costs are kept within limits, predicting monthly expenses, and resolving discrepancies.
Collaborate with editorial and marketing teams to incorporate SEO best practices in content creation and content marketing strategies.
Research and apply the latest SEO recommendations and techniques.
Design and implement effective link-building strategies.
Set clear and measurable goals to track progress and improve marketing performance.
Write high-quality, engaging website content, including blog posts and page descriptions, to enhance search engine rankings. -->
